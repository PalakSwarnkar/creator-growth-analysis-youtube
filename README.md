# YouTube Creator Performance Analysis

Most YouTube videos don’t fail because they’re bad.  
They fail because people click… and the video doesn’t deliver what was promised.

This project looks at **why that happens**, using simulated YouTube performance data to understand how titles, thumbnails, and video length influence real viewer behavior.

---

## Data Used
I used a small, simulated dataset that represents how videos perform on YouTube across one creator’s channel and two competitor channels. Each row in the data represents a single video.

The dataset captures **two key moments**:
- **Before the click:** title style, thumbnail description, upload time  
- **After the click:** CTR, average watch time, 30-second retention, end retention, and watch-time ratio

## What I Analyzed
I analyzed how different content decisions affect viewers at three stages:
1. **The click decision (CTR)**
2. **Early engagement (first 30 seconds)**
3. **Sustained engagement (watch time and end retention)**

The analysis compares:
- Title styles (Clear, Curiosity, Clickbait, Generic)
- Thumbnail clarity and effort
- Video length efficiency
- Performance differences between the creator and competitors

## Positive Insights

### Which titles help people click and stay for the first 30 seconds?
**What I observe:**  
Videos with curiosity-based or clear titles have better 30-second retention compared to generic titles.

**Why this is positive:**  
Clear or curious titles help viewers quickly understand if the video is relevant, so they don’t leave immediately.

**What this implies:**  
Good titles bring the right viewers and reduce early drop-offs, even if they don’t affect long-term retention.

### Do shorter videos keep viewers engaged longer?
**What I observe:**  
Shorter videos have a higher watch-time ratio than longer videos.

**Why this is positive:**  
Short videos are easier to finish, so viewers stay engaged for most of the video.

**What this implies:**  
Keeping videos short and focused improves engagement quality.

## Negative Insights

### Why high clicks don’t mean viewers stay
**What I observe:**  
Videos with very high CTR often have low end retention.

**Why this is negative:**  
Strong or exaggerated titles attract clicks, but viewers leave when the content doesn’t meet expectations.

**What this implies:**  
Chasing clicks alone can hurt viewer trust and long-term engagement.

---

### Which thumbnails get fewer clicks
**What I observe:**  
Some thumbnail styles consistently get fewer clicks.

**Why this is negative:**  
Unclear or low-effort thumbnails don’t show the video’s value quickly, so viewers skip them.

**What this implies:**  
Clear thumbnails can improve CTR without changing the content.

## Surprising Insight

### Fewer clicks, but viewers stay longer
**What I observe:**  
Some videos with lower CTR still show strong watch time and engagement.

**Why this is surprising:**  
Even with fewer clicks, the viewers who do click are genuinely interested and stay longer.

**What this implies:**  
Not every video needs high clicks—some perform better with a smaller but more engaged audience.

## Decisions Based on the Analysis

###  START
- Start using titles that clearly explain the topic or create honest curiosity.
- Start keeping videos short and focused, so viewers can easily watch most of the video.
- Start making simple thumbnails that show the main idea at a glance.

###  STOP
- Stop using clickbait titles that attract clicks but disappoint viewers.
- Stop using confusing or low-effort thumbnails that people ignore.
- Stop judging success only by clicks, without looking at how long viewers stay.

###  TEST
- Test curiosity titles with clearer thumbnails to see if both clicks and early retention improve.
- Test short vs slightly longer videos on the same topic to understand viewer attention.
- Test different thumbnail designs for similar videos to learn what gets more clicks.

---

## One Thing I’m Not Fully Confident About
Viewer behavior may vary by topic, so the same title or thumbnail style might not work equally well for all types of videos.

---

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (data creation, analysis, dashboards)
- Human-centered analytical reasoning

### Final Note
This project focuses on **how people behave**, not just on metrics, and shows how creators can turn data into **clear, practical decisions**.
